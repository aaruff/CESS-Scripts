Admin Scripts
=============
This is a collection of scripts I have written for small
administrative tasks both for myself and for the Center for
Experimental Social Science.


Z-Tree Setup Script
--------------
A Visual Basic Script used to generate an experimenter folder
containing the necessary links and subfolders required to run
Z-Tree in the CESS lab environment.

Brew Binary Linker
------------------
A Bash Script used to link binaries installed using homebrew
to the /usr/local/bin directory.

Project Mover
------------------
A Bash Script used to move my web projects from my development
directory to my web directory. The script takes source and 
destination directories as an argument.
